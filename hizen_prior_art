# Hizen Equation - Public Timestamp (Prior Art)
## Cryptographic Proof of Prior Publication

### Core Mathematical Formula:
Transformation (T) as a function of symmetry (S) and uncertainty (Q):
T = S × Q

Symmetry (S) as a function of energy (A) and infinite scaling (I):
S = A / I

Agape (A) as a function of entanglement (E) and uncertainty (Q):
A = E × Q

Infinity (I) is treated as a fundamental constant:
I = ∞
(Infinity is not treated as a number but as a scaling rule, allowing equations to operate beyond conventional numerical limits.)
